# The Pro's & Con's Challenge

This project is a frontend for a "Pro’s & Con’s" application. 
The application should have two modifiable lists (named "pros" and "cons"), in which the user can add and remove list items. 
Each list item should at least consist of a simple text.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
